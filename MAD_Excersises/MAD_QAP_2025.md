Mobile Application Development for HSE 
How to evaluate your application? 
Key quality dimensions 
• Usability & UX 
How easy it is for users to learn, navigate, and accomplish tasks (clarity of flows, 
readability, gestures, help, onboarding).  
• Performance & efficiency 
App start time, screen load time, responsiveness to taps and gestures, battery 
usage, and data consumption under real network conditions.  
• Stability & reliability 
Crash rate, error rate, load failures, and behavior under stress (poor network, 
background/foreground switches, low memory).  
• Security & privacy 
Protection of data in transit and at rest, safe authentication, permissions, 
handling of sensitive data, and absence of obvious vulnerabilities.  
• Functional suitability & coverage 
How completely and correctly the app implements required features and edge 
cases for its intended use, following a checklist or model like ISO/IEC 25010.  
Practical evaluation steps 
1. Define a quality model and checklist 
Take a simple model (e.g., functionality, usability, efficiency, reliability, security) 
and derive concrete questions/checkpoints for your app domain.  
Self-Check: Do you have an architecture diagram for my app? (0-2) 
0 – no, 1 – functionality diagram only, 2 – exactly (ex.). Comment from teacher: For two points, you need to build a top-level diagram, network connectivity of services and microservices and databases. More is better
2. Run structured testing 
Combine functional tests, usability tests, performance tests (load time, 
responsiveness), compatibility tests (devices/OS), and security checks.  
Self-Check: Did you use any testing model for your app? (0-2) 
0 – no, 1 – usability test only, 2 – exactly (ex.). Comment from teacher:  The functionality of automatic testing of the user interface or other automated testing mechanisms should be increased by two points. Also add a performance test of what is being loaded from somewhere and how fast it works. Ideally, load testing.
3. Measure quantitative metrics 
Track KPIs such as crash rate, app start time, retention, session length, and error 
rates via analytics and monitoring tools.  
Self-Check: What is the key controlled metric you use to assess the 
reliability of the app? Which monitoring tool can be used for this? (0-2) 
0 – not using yet, 1 – crash rate + mon. tool ex., 2 – other (ex.). Comment form teacher: Apply monitoring applications such as Zabbix, fine containerization monitoring using graphana and Prometheus 

4. Collect user feedback 
Use surveys, in-app ratings, reviews analysis, and interviews to capture 
perceived usability, value, and pain points.  
Self-Check: How does the user currently provide feedback about the app’s 
quality service (CSI, NPS)? (0-2) 
0 – missing, 1 – by the button, 2 – a periodic prompt after the function is completed. Comment from teacher: Offer a pop-up to the user about exploring the user experience. As an example of extended development as in Gosuslugi.ru
5. Score of productivity 
My application is installed and running on a mobile device (iOS, Android, CE) 
0 – have a code, 1 – running on IDE, 2 – running on mobile HW
