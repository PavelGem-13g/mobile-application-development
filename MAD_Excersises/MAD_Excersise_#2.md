Practical Exercise: Features
of UI/UX Design for Mobile
Applications
Analysis & Redesign Project
Course: Mobile Application Development (Chapter 2)
Level: Technical University Students
Duration: 6–8 hours self-study + 1–2 hours online discussion
Format: Individual Analysis Report with Low-Fidelity Redesign (2–3 pages)

Exercise Overview
In this exercise, you will analyze a real mobile application through the lens of core UI/UX
design principles, identify usability problems, and propose evidence-based redesigns.
Key Learning Outcomes:
- Recognize how design principles manifest in production applications
- Develop critical eye for usability issues
- Apply human-centered design thinking to problem-solving
- Communicate design rationale clearly

Part A: Principle Identification &
Analysis
Task 1: Real App Audit (Self-Study: 2–3 hours)
Objective: Examine one main screen of a real mobile app against established UI/UX
principles.
Instructions:
1. Choose one app you use regularly (e.g., Instagram, Gmail, Maps, Weather, Notes,
Banking app, etc.).

2. Select one primary screen (home, dashboard, feed, list view, etc.) — not a detail
or settings screen.
3. Document the current state:
- Take a screenshot
- Write a 2–3 sentence description of what the screen does
4. Identify principle implementations — Create a table mapping screen elements
to UI/UX principles:

Deliverable: Completed table (5–7 principles minimum) with detailed notes.

Task 2: Usability Problem Detection (Self-Study: 1–
2 hours)
Objective: Identify and articulate specific UX problems on the same screen.
Instructions:
1. Observe user friction points — Things that slow you down, confuse you, or
require extra taps:
- Hard-to-reach buttons (especially on large phones)
- Unclear labels or icons

- Hidden or buried features
- Inconsistent terminology
- Information overload
- Slow or unclear feedback
2. Document each problem in detail:
Problem
#
What Happens Principle
Violated
User Impact Severity
(1–5)
1 Search icon is in top-
right corner,
unreachable for left-
hand users
Accessibility /
ergonomics
Users must
switch hands or
use two hands
3
2 Icon for "Save" is
ambiguous (star or
bookmark?)
Clarity /
consistency
New users don't
know what it
does
4
3 No indication of how
many items are loaded
vs. total available
Feedback /
transparency
Users unsure if
they've seen
everything
2

3. Prioritize: Identify the top 3 problems by severity and frequency of occurrence.
Deliverable: Table with at least 4–5 problems identified, top 3 highlighted.

Part B: Redesign Proposal
Task 3: Low-Fidelity Redesign Sketch (Self-Study:
2–3 hours)
Objective: Propose layout and interaction improvements addressing the top 3 problems.
Instructions:
1. Sketch a new version of the same screen on paper or in a simple drawing tool
(Figma, Adobe XD, even Google Drawings).
- Keep it simple: Wireframe style (boxes, lines, basic text).
- Focus on layout, not visual design (don't spend time on
colors/typography).
2. For each of your top 3 problems, annotate one specific change:
- Problem: "Search icon unreachable"
▪ Solution: "Move search to bottom-left within thumb zone;
add search bar to top as alternative swipe action"

▪ Principle: Accessibility, touch ergonomics
- Problem: "Icon ambiguity"
▪ Solution: "Replace star icon with filled/outline variants; add
label on first use"
▪ Principle: Clarity, progressive disclosure
- Problem: "No load indicator"
▪ Solution: "Add 'Showing 15 of 47 items' text with 'Load More'
button at bottom"
▪ Principle: Feedback, transparency
3. Show before/after comparison:
- Left side: original screenshot
- Right side: your sketch with annotations
Deliverable:
- Hand-drawn or digital sketch with 3–5 annotated changes
- Clear "before/after" visual comparison
- 1–2 sentences per change explaining the rationale

Task 4: Interaction Flow Narrative (Online: 0.5–1
hour)
Objective: Describe how a user would experience your redesigned screen.
Instructions:
Write a short scenario (200–300 words) describing how a user completes a common task
on your redesigned screen. Include:
1. User goal: "I want to find and save a new recipe"
2. Happy path: Step-by-step interaction flow (tap, swipe, see result)
3. Error recovery: What happens if something goes wrong?
4. Feedback moments: Where does the app confirm the user's action?
Example:
"User opens the app and taps the search button in the bottom-left (now in thumb
zone). Search bar expands. User types 'pasta recipes.' Results appear within 1 second
with a loading indicator. User sees 'Showing 12 of 847 recipes' at the top—transparency
that there's more to explore. User taps a recipe card; detail view opens with 'Save'
button highlighted in primary color. User taps 'Save.' Icon fills and a 2-second toast
says 'Saved to favorites.' User can now navigate back or continue searching."
Deliverable: 200–300-word scenario narrative.

Part C: Reflection & Strategic Thinking
Task 5: Design Decision Justification (Online: 0.5
hour)
Objective: Develop strategic thinking about design trade-offs.
Instructions:
Answer two or three of the following questions (150–200 words total):
1. Trade-offs: Did you choose simplicity over feature completeness (or vice versa)?
Why?
2. Platform conventions: Does your redesign follow Android or iOS design
guidelines? Where did you deviate, and why?
3. Accessibility: Who might struggle with your original design? How does your
redesign help them?
4. Data-driven thinking: If you had one metric to measure the success of your
redesign, what would it be? (e.g., task completion time, error rate, user satisfaction)
5. Future iteration: If users tested your redesign, what would you want to learn in the
next round?
Deliverable: Answers to 2–3 questions, 150–200 words total.

Notes for Instructors
This exercise bridges theory (design principles) and practice (real-world app
analysis). Students develop:
- Critical observation skills
- Problem-solving mindset grounded in evidence
- Communication of design rationale
- Empathy for user experience

Discussion prompts for online session:
- "What principles appeared most often across students' apps?"
- "Which problems are app-specific vs. common across platforms?"
- "How do accessibility and simplicity sometimes conflict?"
- "What would happen if you redesigned for a different user persona?"

Assessment Notes
Grading rubric integration:
- Rubric emphasizes reasoning over perfect design
- Encourages iteration, not perfection
- Values clear communication of rationale
- Recognizes that trade-offs are necessary in real design
